# Writings

A personal site for poems, blogs and quotes in Gujarati, Hindi and English.

It is one folder of static files. No server, no database, no build step, no
account with anyone. GitHub hosts it for free and always has; your writing lives
as a JSON file inside this repository, which means it is versioned, backed up,
and yours. **There is nothing here that can start charging you.**

## Why this shape

| Need | How it is met | What it costs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hosting | GitHub Pages | Free, permanently, for public repos |
| Storage | `data/content.json` in this repo | Free — it is just a file |
| Editing | Admin panel in the browser | Free |
| Publishing | A commit through the GitHub API | Free |
| Fonts | Google Fonts, loaded on demand | Free |
| Feedback | Your email, or any free form service | Free |
| Backups | Git history + an export button | Free |

The one thing a static site genuinely cannot do is *receive* a message. That is
the only place an outside service appears, and it is optional — see
[Feedback](#feedback).

## Turning it on

### 1. Publish the site

In this repository on GitHub: **Settings → Pages**. Under *Build and
deployment*, set **Source: Deploy from a branch**, pick the `main` branch and
the `/ (root)` folder, and save.

A minute later the site is live at:

```
https://penpaper0878.github.io/instatements/writings/
```

Open it on your phone and use *Add to Home Screen* — it installs like an app and
works offline.

### 2. Become the admin

Scroll to the bottom of any page and tap the small **lock**. The first time, you
choose a passphrase; after that it unlocks the editing tools on that device.

You will see a **+** button appear in the corner and a **gear** in the header.

### 3. Make it yours

Gear → **Site**: your name, the site's name, a photo, links, a contact email.
The site name can be different in each language if you want it to be.

Gear → **Theme**: eight palettes, light/dark/automatic, a custom accent colour,
page backgrounds, and a separate font for each of the three scripts.

Gear → **Home page**: the layout, how many pieces show before *See more*, which
tabs exist, and what the big header says.

### 4. Set up publishing

Gear → **Publish**.

The owner and repository should already be filled in. You need one token:

1. Go to **github.com → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens →
   Fine-grained tokens → Generate new token**.
   (Or use the button in the Publish panel, which links straight there.)
2. **Repository access:** *Only select repositories* → `instatements`.
3. **Permissions → Repository permissions → Contents:** *Read and write*.
   Nothing else. That is the whole list.
4. Generate it, copy it, and paste it into the Publish panel.
5. Press **Test connection**. It should say it is connected.

Now **Publish** pushes your work live in about a minute.

> **You paste the token once per device, not once per poem.** It stays in that
> browser — locking the site does not remove it. To read it back later, open
> Settings → Publish and tap the eye beside the Token field; GitHub never shows
> a token a second time, so that field is the only place it still exists. There
> is a *Remove token from this device* button when you actually want it gone.
>
> It is never written into any file this site serves, so no visitor can read it.
> If you lose the device, revoke the token on GitHub and make a new one.

## Writing

Press **+**, or just hit `N`.

- **Kind** — poem, blog or quote. Quotes get centred and styled like quotes;
  blogs get a reading time.
- **Language** — Gujarati, Hindi or English. This picks the typeface and tells
  the browser how to shape the script, so set it correctly.
- **Writing** — your line breaks are kept exactly as typed. In a poem the breaks
  *are* the poem.
- **Keep as draft** — only you can see it. It is not published.

The **Style** tab restyles that one piece on its own: a different typeface, a
larger size, looser lines, a colour, a gradient, or a photograph behind the
words. The preview at the top updates as you type.

Keyboard: `N` for a new piece, `Ctrl/Cmd + S` to publish.

### Tags

Tags are how you get through a few hundred pieces. Add them in the editor,
comma-separated, in any script — `ગઝલ, વરસાદ` works as well as `love, monsoon`.

Every tag on the site is then clickable: on a card, inside a piece, or from the
tag button next to the language filter, which lists all of them with counts.
Clicking the tag that is already filtering turns it off again.

### Bringing in writing you already have

Gear → **Data → Import .txt files**. Select as many as you like; each becomes
one piece, the filename becomes the title, and the language is detected from the
script. Everything arrives as a draft so you can review before publishing.

---

## Sharing

Open any piece and press **Share**:

- **Save as image** — a picture sized for a post, a story or a wide card, drawn
  with your own fonts and colours and signed with your name.
- **Save as PDF** — opens the print dialog; choose *Save as PDF*.
- **Copy as text**, **Download .txt**, **Copy link**, **WhatsApp**, and the
  system share sheet on phones.

> **On link previews.** When you paste a link to one piece into WhatsApp or
> Facebook, the preview card will show the site's name, not the poem. That is
> not a fault you can fix here: the whole site is one file, and the apps that
> build those previews do not run the JavaScript that would pick out the piece.
> Fixing it properly would mean generating a separate HTML file per piece,
> which means a build step — and a build step is the thing that eventually
> breaks or starts costing money. **Share the image instead:** it carries the
> actual words, looks better in a chat, and needs nothing from anyone.

> **Why PDF goes through the print dialog.** JavaScript PDF libraries need an
> embedded font carrying full Indic shaping tables, and mostly render Gujarati
> and Devanagari wrong — broken matras, conjuncts falling apart. The browser's
> own print engine is the same one drawing the text on screen, so it is always
> correct. It is also free and needs no library.

## Feedback

Readers get a feedback form with an optional name and email, and a dropdown so
they can point at one specific piece.

The link only appears once a message has somewhere to go. Two ways:

**Email (nothing to set up).** Gear → Site → Contact email. Send opens the
reader's own mail app with the whole message already written. Always works,
never breaks, costs nothing.

**A form service (messages arrive on their own).** Gear → Feedback → Form
endpoint. Any service that accepts a JSON POST works:

| Service | Endpoint | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Web3Forms | `https://api.web3forms.com/submit` | Also paste the access key |
| Formspree | `https://formspree.io/f/xxxxxxxx` | No key needed |
| Getform | `https://getform.io/f/xxxxxxxx` | No key needed |
| Google Apps Script | your deployed web app URL | Free, and entirely yours |

If the service ever disappears or starts charging, change one field. The email
fallback is always there underneath.

The form carries a hidden honeypot field that silently absorbs bot submissions.

## What "only I can upload" actually means

Worth being precise, because this is a static site and every line of its code is
public.

**The passphrase is a convenience, not a wall.** It is stored as a slow PBKDF2
hash (250,000 rounds, salted), so it cannot be read back out of the file — but a
determined visitor could still flip a flag in their browser's devtools and see
the admin panels.

**That costs nothing, because it changes nothing.** Editing only ever writes to
*their own browser's* storage. The live site is a file in your repository, and
changing it requires the GitHub token — which exists only in your browser and in
no file this site serves. A visitor has nothing to find and nothing to push.

So: the passphrase keeps the interface out of the way, and the token is what
actually makes the site yours.

## Backups

Gear → **Data**:

- **Backup (.json)** — the whole site in one file: every piece, every collection,
  every setting. Keep one somewhere safe.
- **All writing (.txt)** — just the words, readable anywhere, forever.

Every publish is also a Git commit, so the repository already holds every version
you have ever published. Nothing is ever really lost.

**On importing.** A backup file carries settings as well as writing — colours,
fonts, background images, links. Values arriving that way are validated before
they reach the page: markup in a title or a poem is shown as text, a colour that
is not a colour falls back to the theme's, and a background image must be a
plain https or inline image. Still, only restore backups you made yourself.

## A custom domain

Buy a domain anywhere, then in **Settings → Pages → Custom domain** enter it and
add the DNS records GitHub shows you. HTTPS is issued free and renews itself.
Hosting stays free.

## If something goes wrong

**Publish says the token was rejected.** It expired or was revoked. Make a new
one and paste it in.

**Publish says there is no permission.** The token needs *Contents: Read and
write*, and this repository must be in its *Only select repositories* list.

**The site did not update after publishing.** GitHub Pages takes up to a minute.
Check the **Actions** tab for the deployment, then hard-refresh.

**Fonts look wrong.** Google Fonts was unreachable; the site falls back to your
device's own Gujarati and Devanagari fonts and stays readable. It fixes itself on
the next load.

**Everything vanished on a device.** That device had an unpublished draft and
lost its storage. Your published site is unaffected — reload it. Restore a
backup from Gear → Data if you had local work.

**It says "unpublished changes" after I wrote something.** That is the normal
state, not a problem. Writing saves to your device immediately; the live site
only changes when you press **Publish**. The badge clears once you do.

**Locked out of admin.** Edit `data/content.json` in GitHub directly, empty the
`admin.passHash` and `admin.passSalt` strings, and commit. The next unlock lets
you set a new passphrase.
